Frameworkium wraps together a load of nice java libraries and other bits and bobs, to make writing tests - be they web tests, app tests, api tests, other tests that we've not yet thought of - more consistent and more familiar. Ideally, it should mean you spend less time worrying about *plumbing*, and more time thinking about the actual tests themselves. It should also mean your test projects stay clean and focussing on _testing_, rather than full of helpers and widgets.
